            <h2> How I was introduced, what inspired me to continue, and what still inspires me to watch anime </h2>
          <body> 
            <p> I started watching anime on Toonami when I was in middle school. Toonami was a 
            nighttime television program that primarily broadcasted anime. There were multiple 
            shows broadcasted every night not including anime so it was a coincidence that what 
            I watched was an anime.  The first anime I watched was Attack On Titan. I would later 
            continue to watch anime I found on Youtube. When I began watching anime what drew me in 
            was its uniqueness when compared to typical American Cartoons. Everything from the plot to 
            the way characters spoke and acted left a tremendous impression on me. The thirst for more 
            eventually led me to where I am now. What prompts me to continue watching anime is how much it 
            has influenced my life and for enjoyment. Many of my closest friends I bonded with over anime. 
            My life aspirations also can be traced back to watching anime. However, enjoyment is the reason 
            I mainly continue because there isnâ€™t any point if I'm not enjoying myself.
